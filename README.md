# Coursera_Capstone
This project is for the Capstone Project of Applied Data Science in Coursera

## Introduction
I am recently lived in Shanghai, China. However, I was once studied away in New York as an undergraduate student. New York has left me a deep impression on places: resturants, groceries and sight spots.


## Data
The foursquare will be used as database for location. Also, the whole project will be in Jupyter Notebook and several libraries will be imported to help elevate the efficiency and quality of the report.
